# Demo Frontend

This is a demo project to show some cool features of NextJS and MUI and how it is connected to a headless CMS (Payload CMS).

## Notable features include:

- **App router**: see `src/app/`
- **CMS sync scripts (AI generated):** see `scripts/`
- **Page component usage for home, catch all and preview:** see `src/app/(frontend)/[locale]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(frontend)/[locale]/[slug]/page.tsx` and `src/app/(frontend)/[locale]/page-preview/page.tsx`,
- **Data fetching from the CMS:** see `src/fetch/`,
